# A Portal to the Past: An Examination of the Hiroshima Archive


## What is the Hiroshima Archive?
The [Hiroshima Archive (ヒロシマ・アーカイブ)]( http://hiroshima.archiving.jp/index_en.html), is a website compiled to commemorate the massive loss of life in Hiroshima, Japan, during the dropping of an atomic bomb in 1940, and to share the stories of those who survived, died, and of Hiroshima itself. Also, coincidentally, the Hiroshima Archive serves as a wonderful and unique example of a digital humanities project.  

This website, available in both Japanese and English, takes viewers through a Google Earth map of Hiroshima, with plenty of icons on the map, and a large red circle representing ground zero of the blast. If one clicks on the icons, the viewer is presented with a graphic or video resource—sometimes a picture, sometimes a translated text interview or memoir, and sometimes a video about the blast or an interview with survivors. Special icons of paper cranes, a [Japanese symbol of healing]( http://voices.nationalgeographic.com/2015/08/28/how-paper-cranes-become-a-symbol-of-healing-in-japan/), feature videos of local middle and high school students from various schools in the city of Hiroshima talking about the memorials that are in the city to commemorate the event. There is also a box in the corner, kind of like a digital guestbook, that allows viewers and the site’s creators to see who has visited the archive and where they are from, if a visitor so chooses to put their name down. The website itself is unique and incredibly aesthetically pleasing; there appears to have been quite a large amount of work put into this website.  

Out of curiosity, since I speak a *bit* of Japanese, and I am also a Comp. Lit major, a major which heavily focuses on translation, works in the original language, and things that are lost in translation, I decided to see the differences between the Japanese website and the English version. Both sites are the exact same, save for the different language text, which I find interesting, considering that this project is a Japanese project.


## How does it fare as a DH Project?
As a Digital Humanities project, the Hiroshima Archive serves its job well. It is easy-to-navigate, very pleasant to look at, and overall, a great DH project, in my opinion. Its implicit argument against radioactive warfare and argument for the victims of atomic bombs is clear. It is well-organized, if a bit cluttered. All in all, the Archive is an effective visualization of the impact of the bomb on Hiroshima, Japan.  

Everything is sourced correctly, whether it is pictures, video or text excerpts. Along with that, each excerpt, for the most part, has an external link within the pop-up window on the archive site to take you to its source, especially with YouTube videos of interviews or students from a high school/middle school in Hiroshima giving a tour of the local memorials, their faces blurred for presumed privacy reasons. Its thesis—examining the pain and destruction caused by the Hiroshima bomb, to prevent another atomic attack—is clear, even if it is not explicitly articulated on the site itself.  

But, even if the archive is a good example of a Digital Humanities project, that doesn’t mean that it is not without its detractions. For example, the site, having plenty of small intricate parts, takes a long time to load, and is very intense on my personal computer’s operation. So, in other words, this site would not be easy to use on mobile, which is a negative.  

Another roadblock that makes the site a bit more difficult to use is that it was not fully translated for the English version. For English-speakers only, even on the English version of the archive, there are no subtitles for videos, which leaves something to be desired. So, there is a language barrier here that could have been traversed more efficiently. While I understand that it takes plenty of time to subtitle and translate, for a non-Japanese-speaking audience, that would have been a nice touch.  

Along with that, I personally become motion sick relatively easily, and the transition animations on the Google Earth map for when I clicked on every icon were quick and jarring enough to make me feel slightly motion-sick. I will admit, that is a personal thing, and not a true indicator of every person’s experience, though it is worth mentioning. So, overall, these are all things to keep in mind that do detract a bit from the project.  


## The Verdict
All in all, I found the Hiroshima Archive to be a unique, but also very effective Digital Humanities project that puts into perspective the true amount of pain, suffering and sadness caused to Hiroshima by the dropping of the atomic bomb. While there are some drawbacks, such as its long load time and lack of translation on some sections, it is an incredibly effective memorial for those who lost their lives during the attack. Also, most of all, the Hiroshima Archive is a reminder that humanity cannot afford to forget atrocities like this, and that Digital Humanities can keep the memory alive.
